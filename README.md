Some C++ programs I've written for college projects

## right-triangle.cpp
Determines if the sides input equal a right triangle

## number-reverse.cpp
Reverses the order of the numbers input

## remove-vowels.cpp
Removes vowels from a string

## prime-number-check.cpp
Determines if the input number is a prime number up to 10,008
Limit can be modified to go higher if needed

## string-encoding.cpp
Takes a string as input and then does a few things
1. Randomizes the order of the words in the sentence
2. Sorts the words of the sentence in ascending order (can also be modified to sort by descending)
3. Applies ROT13 encoding to the sentence
